                    <h2>Sports  <i class="fas fa-futbol fa-lg"></i></h2>
                        Have been playing since a kid all kind of sports actively, which nowadays sums up to Football, Tennis, Golf and Gym.<br>
    
                    <h2>Gaming & Computer software  <i class="fas fa-laptop fa-sm"></i></h2>
                        As a child I was very curious of my familys computer and to learn everything what can be done with it. I used to dissemble even old electronics to see for myself how they were build up and understand better how they work. This led to that I also wanted to order Mikrobitti magazine (Finnish IT magazine) instead of Donald Duck.<br>
                        This lead towards interest also in gaming and have been a big interest ever since. I enjoyed competitive fast paced games which increased reaction speed and desicion making significatly. Nowadays though time is more limited so have only rarely time to spend on gaming anymore.
                        <br><br>

                    <h2>Music   <i class="fas fa-music"></i></h2>
                        I started playing the clarinet when I was on elementary school in Eastern Helsinki Musical Institute. During this time I also completed all 3/3 music theory classes. I played mostly classical and jazz music.
                        I performed mostly with piano composition and sometimes solo. After couple years of training I started to play also in the music institutes own orchestra.<br>
                        At some point I wanted to learn more instruments so I took saxophone and piano to my collection. I wanted to connect now music with IT interests, so I connected my keyboard to my computer and started editing my own music.<br><br>

                    <h2>Food & Wine  <i class="fas fa-utensils fa-lg"></i>  <i class="fas fa-wine-glass-alt fa-lg"></i></h2>
                        Food has always been a big part of my life. And ever since I worked in 8 different restaurants I managed to develop quite some skills in that skilltree.
                        Wine has also been a big interest since 2009. I have travelled around in France and Italy going through different wineyards and there is few things that are better than the perfect wine with the perfect dish. <br><br>

                        Nowadays I am my own masterchef and continue to develop my culinary skillset in the kitchen at home.
